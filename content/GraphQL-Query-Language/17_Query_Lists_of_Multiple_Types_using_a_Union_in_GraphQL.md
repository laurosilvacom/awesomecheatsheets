# 17. Query Lists of Multiple Types using a Union in GraphQL

In the refactored pet library there are some more queries that we haven't had a look at yet, `familyPets` and `exoticPets`.

If you open up the schema and click on `familyPets`, you will see some helpful documentation that says `"This query returns a list of Family Pets, either a Cat or Dog."`

Another useful data structure when working with GraphQL is a `union`. We use a union when we want to return a list of multiple types.

Unions don't share any fields, so if we try to query the `name` field, we will get an error.

```
"Cannot query field \"name\" on type \"FamilyPet\". Did you mean to use an inline fragment on \"Pet\", \"Cat\", or \"Dog\"?"
```

If we want to query additional pet data, we can use inline fragments.

```graphql
query {
  familyPets {
    __typename
    # This queries cat specific data
    ... on Cat {
      name
      sleepAmount
    }
    # This queries dog specific data
    ... on Dog {
      name
      good
    }
  }
}
```

We will see that the error now goes away, and we get back out data. ðŸ¥³
