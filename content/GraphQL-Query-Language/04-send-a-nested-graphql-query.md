## Summary

In this lesson, weâ€™ll take a closer look at the Photo type and how it can be used to store more complex data types.

## Notes

The photo type has fields for full-size image and thumbnail-size image, both of which are strings. Each pet would have a photo.

If I query `photo`, it gives me this error message that says:

```
"Field photo of type photo must have a selection of subfields."
```

```graphql
query {
  allPets {
    name
    weight
    category
    photo
  }
  totalPets
}
```

Because photo is an object, I'm going to need to add another selection set here.

This allows us to have some flexibility when we are sending a query.

A photo may have more than one field associated with it. Then we can request just the fields that we want with our GraphQL query.

## Personal Take

In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments, the query parameters and URL segments in your request.

But in GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches.

You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately.
