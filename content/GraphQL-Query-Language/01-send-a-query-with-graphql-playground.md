## Summary

In this lesson, we will send a query to obtain the total number of pets registered at the Pet Library.

## Notes

In this lesson, we send a query to obtain the total number of pets registered at the Pet Library.

When we go to this route `https://pet-library.moonhighway.com` a tool called GraphQL Playground will pop up in the browser.

**GraphQL Playground** is an in-browser IDE that lets you send queries to GraphQL endpoints.

With GraphQL, there's only one endpoint, so you need to specify the data that you want by writing a query on the left-hand side of the screen.

```graphql
query {
  totalPets
}
```

When clicking play the data returned is JSON. It matches the shape of the response exactly. All of the feels are the same:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "totalPets": 25
  }
}
```

## Personal Take

It's important to understand that GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
