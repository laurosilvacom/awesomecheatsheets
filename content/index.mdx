# Section 1: Setup

## Prerequisites

1. good understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org)
2. familiarity with [TypeScript Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) ([2ality's guide](http://2ality.com/2018/04/type-notation-typescript.html) is helpful)
3. having read [the TypeScript section in the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#typescript).
4. having read [the React section of the new TypeScript playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?jsx=2&esModuleInterop=true&e=181#example/typescript-with-react) (optional: also step through the 40+ examples under [the playground's](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html) Examples section)

This guide will always assume you are starting with the latest TypeScript version. Notes for older versions will be in expandable `<details>` tags.

## React + TypeScript Starter Kits

1. [Create React App v2.1+ with Typescript](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript): `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`

- We used to recommend `create-react-app-typescript` but it is now [deprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/a5919a/createreactapptypescript_has_been_archived_rip/). [see migration instructions](https://vincenttunru.com/migrate-create-react-app-typescript-to-create-react-app/)

2. [Basarat's guide](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-react/tree/master/01%20bootstrap) for **manual setup** of React + TypeScript + Webpack + Babel

- In particular, make sure that you have `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` installed ([Read more about the DefinitelyTyped project if you are unfamiliar](https://definitelytyped.org/))
- There are also many React + TypeScript boilerplates, please see [our Resources list below](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet#recommended-react--typescript-codebases-to-learn-from).

## Import React

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

In [TypeScript 2.7+](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html), you can run TypeScript with `--allowSyntheticDefaultImports` (or add `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` to tsconfig) to import like in regular jsx:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

<details>

<summary>Explanation</summary>

Why `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` over `esModuleInterop`? [Daniel Rosenwasser](https://twitter.com/drosenwasser/status/1003097042653073408) has said that it's better for webpack/parcel. For more discussion check out <https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript/issues/214>

You should also check [the new TypeScript docs for official descriptions between each compiler flag](https://www.typescriptlang.org/v2/en/tsconfig#allowSyntheticDefaultImports)!

# Section 2: Getting Started

## Function Components

These can be written as normal functions that take a `props` argument and return a JSX element.

```tsx
type AppProps = { message: string }; /* could also use interface */
const App = ({ message }: AppProps) => <div>{message}</div>;
```

<details>

<summary><b>What about `React.FC`/`React.FunctionComponent`?</b></summary>

You can also write components with `React.FunctionComponent` (or the shorthand `React.FC`):

```tsx
const App: React.FC<{ message: string }> = ({ message }) => (
  <div>{message}</div>
);
```

Some differences from the "normal function" version:

- It provides typechecking and autocomplete for static properties like `displayName`, `propTypes`, and `defaultProps` - **However**, there are currently known issues using `defaultProps` with `React.FunctionComponent`. See [this issue for details](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/issues/87) - scroll down to our `defaultProps` section for typing recommendations there.

- It provides an implicit definition of `children` (see below) - however there are some issues with the implicit `children` type (e.g. [DefinitelyTyped#33006](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33006)), and it might considered better style to be explicit about components that consume `children`, anyway.

```tsx
const Title: React.FunctionComponent<{ title: string }> = ({
  children,
  title
}) => <div title={title}>{children}</div>;
```

- _In the future_, it may automatically mark props as `readonly`, though that's a moot point if the props object is destructured in the parameter list.

- `React.FunctionComponent` is explicit about the return type, while the normal function version is implicit (or else needs additional annotation).

In most cases it makes very little difference which syntax is used, but the `React.FC` syntax is slightly more verbose without providing clear advantage, so precedence was given to the "normal function" syntax.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Minor Pitfalls</b></summary>

These patterns are not supported:

**Conditional rendering**

```tsx
const MyConditionalComponent = ({ shouldRender = false }) =>
  shouldRender ? <div /> : false; // don't do this in JS either
const el = <MyConditionalComponent />; // throws an error
```

This is because due to limitations in the compiler, function components cannot return anything other than a JSX expression or `null`, otherwise it complains with a cryptic error message saying that the other type is not assignable to `Element`.

```tsx
const MyArrayComponent = () => Array(5).fill(<div />);
const el2 = <MyArrayComponent />; // throws an error
```

**Array.fill**

Unfortunately just annotating the function type will not help so if you really need to return other exotic types that React supports, you'd need to perform a type assertion:

```tsx
const MyArrayComponent = () => (Array(5).fill(<div />) as any) as JSX.Element;
```

[See commentary by @ferdaber here](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/issues/57).

## Hooks

Hooks are [supported in `@types/react` from v16.8 up](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/a05cc538a42243c632f054e42eab483ebf1560ab/types/react/index.d.ts#L800-L1031).

**useState**

Type inference works very well most of the time:

```tsx
const [val, toggle] = React.useState(false); // `val` is inferred to be a boolean, `toggle` only takes booleans
```

See also the [Using Inferred Types](#using-inferred-types) section if you need to use a complex type that you've relied on inference for.

However, many hooks are initialized with null-ish default values, and you may wonder how to provide types. Explicitly declare the type, and use a union type:

```tsx
const [user, setUser] = React.useState<IUser | null>(null);

// later...
setUser(newUser);
```

**useRef**

When using `useRef`, you have two options when creating a ref container that does not have an initial value:

```ts
const ref1 = useRef<HTMLElement>(null!);
const ref2 = useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);
```

The first option will make `ref1.current` read-only, and is intended to be passed in to built-in `ref` attributes that React will manage (because React handles setting the `current` value for you).

The second option will make `ref2.current` mutable, and is intended for "instance variables" that you manage yourself.

**useEffect**

When using `useEffect`, take care not to return anything other than a function or `undefined`, otherwise both TypeScript and React will yell at you. This can be subtle when using arrow functions:

```ts
function DelayedEffect(props: { timerMs: number }) {
  const { timerMs } = props;
  // bad! setTimeout implicitly returns a number because the arrow function body isn't wrapped in curly braces
  useEffect(
    () =>
      setTimeout(() => {
        /* do stuff */
      }, timerMs),
    [timerMs]
  );
  return null;
}
```

**useRef**

```tsx
function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  // initialise with null, but tell TypeScript we are looking for an HTMLInputElement
  const inputEl = React.useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // strict null checks need us to check if inputEl and current exist.
    // but once current exists, it is of type HTMLInputElement, thus it
    // has the method focus! ✅
    if (inputEl && inputEl.current) {
      inputEl.current.focus();
    }
  };
  return (
    <>
      {/* in addition, inputEl only can be used with input elements. Yay! */}
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

**useReducer**

You can use [Discriminated Unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions) for reducer actions. Don't forget to define the return type of reducer, otherwise Typescript will infer it.

```tsx
type AppState = {};
type Action =
  | { type: "SET_ONE"; payload: string }
  | { type: "SET_TWO"; payload: number };

export function reducer(state: AppState, action: Action): AppState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_ONE":
      return {
        ...state,
        one: action.payload // `payload` is string
      };
    case "SET_TWO":
      return {
        ...state,
        two: action.payload // `payload` is number
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
