metaTitle: "Develop and Publish a Node.js CLI from Scratch"
metaDescription: "Here we explain everything you need to know to write a complete Node.js CLI from scratch, parse arguments, publish it to NPM for users, and set up yarn symlinks for optimal developer experience."
---

## Notes

A minimum viable CLI can be a simple JS file:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("hello world!");
```

\*nix systems also require you to mark these files as executable before you run them:

```shell
chmod +x foo.js   # mark executable
./foo.js          # run the file

```

You can can handle arguments in whatever way you see fit. For example, one of the typical ways is to do it positionally:

- If I want to have the convention that the first argument is the specified directory: `args[0]`
- and to take a name flag by parsing the name flag: `args[1].slice("--name=")[1]`

To publish just use `npm publish` like any other npm project. This includes a run.cmd script that will automatically be used for Windows users.

```shell
$ npm version (major|minor|patch) # bumps version, updates README, adds git tag
$ npm publish
$ npm install -g mynewcli
$ mynewcli
# OR
$ npx mynewcli
```

## Personal Take

Node.js isn't the only language/environment to write CLI's with. It can be slower than Go or Rust. But it has two advantages:

- JS devs will already have it installed, no extra step needed
- Being able to leverage the vast npm ecosystem, including everything Sindre Sorhus has done
